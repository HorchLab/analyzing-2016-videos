# horch-scripts
Scripts created for the Horch Lab at Bowdoin College

### Python Script
The python script "trying_area.py" is used to identify the color of the light for an area around a pixel identified using DeepLabCut (DLC). The inputs are the location of the light in each frame (csv file produced by DLC), and the video itself. The output is a csv file that includes the average RBG value for the area around the center of the red and green lights in each frame.

### R Scripts
The R script imageJ_method.R should be used to process the videos analyzed using ImageJ  
The R Script python.meth.R should be used to process the videos analyzed using Python.
